Techniques such as ATDD, BDD and Specification by Example help us understand the requirements by describing how the software has to behave in a language understood by all stakeholders. These specifications are made executable; creating automated acceptance tests. This suite of executable specifications forms the living documentation of the software system as it is guaranteed to be up to date. \r\n\r\nThere are several tools available that can help you with this.
