We all know that change is a constant, but so is failure. Having that, your development and operations is wrong, if changes and failures are seen as the result of bad decisions more than as result of a learning curve. But failing is not simple and on this ignite talk I’ll cover the following considerations around DevOps, failure, and innovation:\r\nSee your project as an R&D project\r\nExpect failure more than you expect change\r\nThere's no way to run away from 'people process and tools'\r\nYou need a good enterprise architect\r\nPray for your boss"},"fromTime":"13:25","toTimeMillis":1447331400000,"toTime":"13:30","roomCapacity":70,"roomName":"BOF 1","slotId":"ignite_bof1_thursday_12_13h25_13h30","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"bof1","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1447331400000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"classroom","talk":{"trackId":"methodevops","talkType":"Ignite Sessions","track":"Methodology & DevOps","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Is this short talk I will Ignite you with some cool pictures of my journey around the world and correlate them in an ironic way to DevOps</p>\n","id":"SCS-4448","speakers":[{"link":{"href":"http://cfp.devoxx.be/api/conferences/DV15/speakers/3fba21b44cd0bffadc47087951980a7fb1916df9","rel":"http://cfp.devoxx.be/api/profile/speaker","title":"Niek Palm"},"name":"Niek Palm"}],"title":"What I learned around the world about DevOps","lang":"en","summary":"Is this short talk I will Ignite you with some cool pictures of my journey around the world and correlate them in an ironic way to DevOps"},"fromTime":"13:30","toTimeMillis":1447331700000,"toTime":"13:35","roomCapacity":70,"roomName":"BOF 1","slotId":"ignite_bof1_thursday_12_13h30_13h35","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room8","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1447331700000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"future","talkType":"Quickie","track":"Future<Devoxx>","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Algorithmic 3-D modeling can be very complex and time-consuming and demands specialized design tools that typically have a steep learning curve.
