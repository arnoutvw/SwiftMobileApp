All this coming from experience (and mistakes) of building tools for the microservices infrastructure at Allegro.\r\n\r\nI hope to leave you with practical knowledge essential for building successful tools – both for growing internal commons ecosystems and for creating useful open-source projects."},"fromTime":"15:10","toTimeMillis":1466604000000,"toTime":"16:00","roomCapacity":400,"roomName":"Room 4","slotId":"conf_room4_wednesday_22_15h10_16h0","day":"wednesday"},{"roomId":"room5","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1466601000000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"agTest","talkType":"Conference","track":"Methodology & Culture","summaryAsHtml":"<p>This session walks the audience through a few cool tips and tricks to modernize their application development and devops workflows.

The majority of the session focusses on how to use Reactive Java and attendees will learn how to:\r\n\r\n* Identify and use the common Reactive patterns\r\n* De-couple parts of their applications using Reactive components\r\n* Improve testability of their components using Reactive\r\n* Use Reactive as a model for asynchronous processing in a real application\r\n"},"fromTime":"10:20","toTimeMillis":1466673000000,"toTime":"11:10","roomCapacity":600,"roomName":"Room 2","slotId":"conf_room2_thursday_23_10h20_11h10","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room3","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1466670000000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"bigd","talkType":"Conference","track":"Big Data & Analytics","summaryAsHtml":"<p>Cassandra 3.0 has been released for a while, it&#x27;s high time to look at the new features that will make your life easier:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>the new User Defined Functions (UDF) and User Defined Aggregates (UDA) which allow you to create code in the language of your choice (JVM compatible) and push the computation to the server</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>the JSON syntax that can be used to push data directly into Cassandra without the pain of converting JSON to regular literal values</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>the new Materialized Views (MV) that make de-normalization easier for the developers</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>the new SASI full text search feature that allow you to perform dynamic queries on your Cassandra data</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","id":"CNN-0761","speakers":[{"link":{"href":"http://cfp.devoxx.pl/api/conferences/DevoxxPL2016/speakers/278e44080e10ffd805e5fbda6d0690862b361196","rel":"http://cfp.devoxx.pl/api/profile/speaker","title":"DuyHai DOAN"},"name":"DuyHai DOAN"}],"title":"New Cassandra 3 features that change your (developer) life","lang":"en","summary":"Cassandra 3.0 has been released for a while, it's high time to look at the new features that will make your life easier:\r\n\r\n1. the new User Defined Functions (UDF) and User Defined Aggregates (UDA) which allow you to create code in the language of your choice (JVM compatible) and push the computation to the server\r\n\r\n2. the JSON syntax that can be used to push data directly into Cassandra without the pain of converting JSON to regular literal values\r\n\r\n3. the new Materialized Views (MV) that make de-normalization easier for the developers\r\n\r\n4. the new SASI full text search feature that allow you to perform dynamic queries on your Cassandra data\r\n"},"fromTime":"10:20","toTimeMillis":1466673000000,"toTime":"11:10","roomCapacity":300,"roomName":"Room 3","slotId":"conf_room3_thursday_23_10h20_11h10","day":"thursday"},{"roomId":"room4","notAllocated":false,"fromTimeMillis":1466670000000,"break":null,"roomSetup":"theatre","talk":{"trackId":"agTest","talkType":"Conference","track":"Methodology & Culture","summaryAsHtml":"<p>REST APIs are the language of the web.
